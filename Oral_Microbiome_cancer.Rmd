# PLOS 'Pearl'-style minireview

## Pearls may take one of the two following formats:

-   "Five facts about X": In this format, authors list significant facts about a topic and then summarize the evidence for them.

-   "Q&A": In this format, each paragraph involves a question followed by an answer -- a more conversational style that may suit some topics better.
